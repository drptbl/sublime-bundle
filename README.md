WebdriverIO Sublime Text 2/3 bundle
===================================

This is a package for [Sublime Text 2 & 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) that provides autocompletion
for all [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) action and protocol commands. It makes writing integration
test with WebdriverIO a breeze.

# Installation

1. Open Package Control: `Preferences -> Package Control`
2. Select Package Control: `Install Package`
3. Type `WebdriverIO` into the search box and select the package to install it

# Usage

Currently this plugin only provides autocompletion. But there will be more features comming. Feature
requests or even pull requests are much appriciated.

Just type the first letters of a command and Sublime Text will offer all WebdriverIO matching that
pattern. E.g. initializing a Selenium session with WebdriverIO:
